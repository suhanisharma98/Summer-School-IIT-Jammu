DOCUMENTATION

1. HTML Elements Used:

- <header>: Used to wrap the page header and navigation links.
- <nav>: Holds the navigation menu so users can move between pages.
- <main>: Main content area of the page.
- <section>: Groups related content like Skills, Education, etc.
- <h1> to <h6>: Used to create a proper content hierarchy.
- <ul>, <ol>: Used to list items (unordered and ordered).
- <img>: Used to display my picture with proper alt text.
- <table>: Used to present my project experience in tabular format.
- <form>: Used in contact.html to collect user details.
- <input>, <textarea>: Used for form fields.
- <fieldset>, <legend>: Used to group radio buttons and checkboxes.

2. Why I choose specific input types:

- text: For basic input like name.
- email: Ensures the user enters a valid email format.
- tel: Allows numeric phone number input.
- textarea: For longer messages or feedback.
- checkbox: To let users select multiple contact methods.
- radio: For selecting only one inquiry type.
- date, range, and select: For enhanced interaction (Part 2).

3. Navigation Structure:

Each page has a <nav> section with links like:
- Home (portfolio.html)
- About Me (about.html)
- Contact (contact.html)

These internal links help users navigate between pages easily. External links (like MDN or W3Schools) open in new tabs.
